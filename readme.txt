Purpose:
This project is designed to provide a cloud-based online database manager. It allows for users to view and modify data tables online. Access to these tables is restricted by various levels of permissions set for each user and each table. The database also allows for the application of filters and search criterea to narrow results, and allow users to download a report (CSV) containing all of the data that fits their filters and search criteria. The software is also capable of tracking modifications, and will record a note of any edit by any user. In many ways, the functionality of this software is similar to that of Sheets in Google Docs. 

Note: this is an updated version using mysqli (the original version used mysql)
